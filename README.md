# -Intro-to-iOS-Project-1---Review-My-TipCalc-App
Created Aug 2015 by Randy Mako for CodePath's intro to iOS

This is the basic build from the tutorial. I will be updating with styling soon, so check back! 

Known issues: I couldn't change the phone size to an iPhone 6 nor could I change the iPhone emulator down to an iPhone 5 - Looking into fixing this.

I tried some 'advanced' features but couldn't get them to work. I am pretty excited to continue working on animations and expanded features.
